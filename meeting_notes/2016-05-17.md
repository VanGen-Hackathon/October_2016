High Priority

1. Team leader applications 
Update on numbers from Britt & Catrina
Advertising push before deadline of June 2nd?
Twitter
email
other?
How are we going to make projects accessible for participants to view? (I think these can be public)
      Possible options:
Github issues in a new repo called "projects"?
Website? 
other?
Example projects from previous hackathons
We have a list from DCGenomics: https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/issues/22
How do we share these examples with team leaders?

2. Participant applications
Update on application form status from Santina
How are we going to make participants applications available for project leaders to view? (I don't think these should be public...)
Advertising push before deadline of June 30th?
Twitter
email
other?

3. Team selection & notification
Volunteer needed to write a public document about how teams are selected and put it in repo
Volunteer needed to draft team leader and team member notification email
Volunteer needed to notify teams on July 15th
Volunteer(s) needed to aggregate results of cross voting between team leaders and participants to come up with who will be attending.

4. Travel award
 ASHG has approved up to $4,500 (or 3 travel grants) for hackseq participants
Each recipient must be:
A trainee (e.g., a graduate student or post-doc)
A member of ASHG (membership number required)
Registered for the 2016 ASHG Annual Meeting in Vancouver
Following questions have(?) been added to participant application form:
Do you require a travel grant to participate? If yes, ask if they fulfill the requirements above to apply for one
Why would you like to participate in hackseq?
How did you hear about hackseq? Options (Twitter, Facebook, email, friend...etc)
where are you travelling from
idea - add question where they justify their financial need

5. Next meeting
date
format
location
meeting frequency

6. AWS cloud credits 
Update from Shaun and Adriana
See https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/issues/6
deadline June 30 
Galaxy?

7.  Logistics
updates from Bruno and Adriana
Code of Conduct
look for product sponsors: eg redbull - monster, clif, terra chips, chipotle, chocolates?
Hackathon term
consensus that it is too late to change name now
new document for things to consider next time we plan things: https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/blob/master/suggestions_for_next_time.md
idea - parallel track with training workshops or talks? see this issue: https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/issues/23

8. Awards  
At previous meeting we decided we would give out a top prize for "Peoples choice"
Idea - we can use remaining money to give out swag for all participants?
At end of Hackathon, have a show and tell where each group has 3-5 minutes to show what they created (people's choice can be voted on after show & tell)
At last meeting we also discussed that we would not have judges because external judges take away from the collaborative feel we want to generate with the hackathon

9. Encouraging women
Child-care

9. non-profit: 
If we want to register a new non-profit in the future weâ€™ll need: 
At least 5 peoples to act as Directors [we'll vote for positions later]; 
$~150;  
A name with the designation "Society" or "Association" or "Foundation"; 
Purposes of the society: statement(s) indicating why the society exists and how we intend to promote these purposes; (v) Review or create the bylaws...  
Something to discuss with VanBUG and other groups?
