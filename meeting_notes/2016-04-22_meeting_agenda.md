## Items to discuss

- Right now the expectations of the projects as described on the website are vague.
  - Discuss some examples of appropriate project ideas to be included in the website so that team leaders (perhaps new to hackathons) have can get an idea how to structure their project and participants know what to expect
    - Are we looking for business ideas? Small bioinformatics software? Hypothesis-driven data analysis? Mock-ups of web services? Mobile apps? 
    - We need criteria for acceptable projects. 
  - Alternatively or in combination with, also discuss how the participants will be judged based on their progress on the project to give the participants and team leaders an idea of what project they can work on
