## Items to discuss

Items to discuss

0. New Members
 - Eva Yap from GSC is interested in helping. --> Promotion (?)

1. Planning
 - we need to decide on firm dates for team leader project proposal, participant application, team selection, decision & notification of travel awards
 - Proposed dates from Shaun:
    - Thu June 2: Team leader project proposal due
    - Thu Jun 30: Participant application due
    - Fri Jul 15: Decide on teams & travel awards
    - we agreed on above dates
  
2. Promotion
- Artem - More use of twitter account
- Amy: nothing finalized, need team leader with project proposals before we can promote it further, announcement at the next VanBug (Tweet about the team leads)
- Galen: send out team leader application
- Connect with the ASHG Twitter account
- Connect with the GenomeBC/Genome Canada Twitter Canada

- Let people know that we are open for applications via twitter
- email blast to departments? BD - yes the more we can advertise the better
- Emailing the VanBUG and other BUGs in Canada, Bioinformatics.ca, ASHG mailing list, SWC, Mozilla Science Foundation 
- Connect with Genome Canada Email
- Get email draft from Briitt for the Team Lead
- BD are there more bioinformatics societies that we can advertise through? (I have contacted all human genetics societies who are full members of IFHGS)
- SL & BG - need criteria for acceptable projects, and more other details (judging criteria, few example projects would help give people an idea of what we are looking for) before we can effectively promote this event to people. So we need to figure out #3 and #4 and have that information on the website first.
- use NCBI past projects as examples

3. Team leader selection criteria    
  - Academia, Industry, etc  - promote inclusivity and if it overcrowds academia team leaders then intervene 
  - Themes: health, environment, etc
  - Applications from committee and/or partners - approach Roche sequencing team and they will be sending technicians to ASH-G
  
4. Project scope & focus, and rubrics for judging
- Bruno: Projects could be very diverse, how to judge different projects? Create an environment for people to have fun
- General comment: who should be the judges? How do we determine the criteria for the judges?
- Artem: give students a grant after the hackathon to continue the project, we will be the incubator!
- Tiffany: Have a show and tell at the end for the teams to talk about what they've worked on. This is more about collaboration and making it fun.
- Shaun: A people's choice award at the end? +1 TT
- Right now the expectations of the projects as described on the website are vague.
  - Discuss some examples of appropriate project ideas to be included in the website so that team leaders (perhaps new to hackathons) have can get an idea how to structure their project and participants know what to expect
    - Are we looking for business ideas? Small bioinformatics software? Hypothesis-driven data analysis? Mock-ups of web services? Mobile apps? 
    - We need criteria for acceptable projects. 
  - Alternatively or in combination with, also discuss how the participants will be judged based on their progress on the project to give the participants and team leaders an idea of what project they can work on

5. AWS budgets
  - See https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/issues/6

6. 10X genomics collaboration (Deanna Church)?

  - child care
