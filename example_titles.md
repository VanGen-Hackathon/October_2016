# Sample project titles 

Need some inspiration to come up with a genomics and bioinformatics oriented project for Hackseq? Here are the titles of the projects 
submitted to the NCBI hackathon. Some of them became the projects you see on the [NCBI Hackathons Github organization](https://github.com/NCBI-hackathons)
