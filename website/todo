## Tasks for Website
Add things as needed (top = high priority)

### High Priority Tasks
*Intro:
- From previous materials. Feel free to edit: 
'Why: The rapid explosion in genomic data demands a foundation of reliable analytical tools in the context of specific research questions'
'Goals: Our aim is to bring together a diverse pool of researchers from academia and industry to generate pipelines and software for the analysis of 'omics' data. All pipelines and software created will be added to the hackseq github repository and will contribute to the advancement of diverse research fields, including personalized medicine, environmental genomics, metagenomics and machine learning'
*The format:
(refer to NCBI?)
'This event is intended for students, postdocs and other investigators engaged in the use of pipelines for genomic analyses from next generation sequencing data and other omics data (eg. RNA-seq, proteomics, etc)' 
'Groups of 5 participants will be formed for 20 teams, in the following sections: (TBA by team leaders). The working groups will build pipelines to analyze large datasets within a cloud infrastructure' 
(should we add here a brief explanation on how we will be selecting projects and participants?)
*Diagram:
(could we include more info about the format and participants? (it seems that it is targeted at team leaders))
* Who We Are Page
- steering committee photos
* Dates for hackathon
- agenda graphics including (coming soon..)
* Team Leader Application Form
(we want to encourage female participation - maybe add female and male icons?)
- need questions that Leader Liason would like to include
- have Shaun check form for sorting compatibility later
(could we have the forms appearing in different pages? - one for team leaders, one for participants)
* Add partners:
-SCWIST, ECOSCOPE, ASHG, 
- Maybe NCBI
- more coming soon.

### Low Priority Tasks
* Upkeep general descriptions
* Compile useful tools that participants might need
