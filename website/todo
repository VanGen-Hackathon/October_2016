## Tasks for Website
Add things as needed (top = high priority)

### High Priority Tasks

* Who We Are Page
- Photos required from: Bruno, Shaun, Amy, Santina and Catrina

* Team Leader Application Form (not website design)
- For now I have email sign-ups for either Team Leaders or Collaborators
- When the Team Leader / Participant Liasons finilize the forms we can contact the email-list
(we want to encourage female participation - maybe add female and male icons?)
- need questions that Leader Liason would like to include
- have Shaun check form for sorting compatibility later
(could we have the forms appearing in different pages? - one for team leaders, one for participants)

* Partners and Sponsors
- Waiting on logos from: PMI(?), Bioinformatics.ca, ECOSCOPE

### Low Priority Tasks
* Upkeep general descriptions
* Compile useful tools that participants might need
